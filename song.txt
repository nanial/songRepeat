I Can't Quit You, Baby, so I'm gonna put you down for awhile.
I said, I can't quit you, baby, I guess I gotta put you down for awhile.
Said you messed up my happy home, made me mistreat my only child.

Said you know I love you, baby, my love for you I could never hide.
Oh, you know I love you, baby, my love for you I could never hide.
When I feel you near me little girl, I know you are my one desire.





Oh, when you hear me holler baby, you know you're my one desire. Yes, you are.
When you hear me moaning and groaning
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me moaning and groaning, baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me holler, baby
You know you're my one desire
Yes, you are[x2:]
When you hear me moaning and groaning, baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside.
